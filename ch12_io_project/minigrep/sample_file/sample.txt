Smeagol : Clever Hobbits, to climb so high!
[jumps on them, pins Frodo to the ground and grips him by the throat] 
Smeagol : Mustn't go that way! Mustn't hurt the Precious!
Frodo : You swore! You swore on the Precious!
Smeagol : [mocking]  Oo-hoo-hoo-hoo...
Frodo : SMEAGOL PROMISED!
Smeagol : Smeagol lied.
[In the "Fall of Smeagol" flashback, after Smeagol had killed Deagol for the ring, Smeagol is stumbling along a stony area, railing noisely and in anguish at being exiled by his own family] 
Gollum : [narrating]  They cursed us. Murderer they called us. They cursed us, and drove us away...
[Smeagol is seen sitting alone in a stony quarry. He is looking pale and sickly as he opens his hand, revealing the ring in his palm] 
Smeagol : [throaty cough; his voice slowly becoming guttural]  Gollum... Gollum... Gollum!
[Smeagol lets out a croaking sound as his face contorts with self-pity and sorrow. He weeps as the screen fades to black] 
Gollum : [narrating cont.; scene shows a balding, pale and rapidly thin Smeagol crying, rocking with sorrow in the rain]  And we wept precious... We wept to be so alone...
[Scene shows Smeagol's pale, thin hand grabbing at a catfish] 
Gollum : [narrating cont.; Closeup on Smeagol's mouth, which is full of tooth decay and hunger-induced drool]  And all we wished was to catch fish...
[Scene shows Smeagol's mouth biting into the catfish's raw flesh] 
Gollum : ...So juicy sweet!
[a quick glimpse of the deteriorated, if slightly shadowed Smeagol's face. And then, the scene shifts to the boney, emaciated Smeagol crawling his way into the cave under the Misty Mountains. But then he stops to take one good look around] 
Gollum : We soon forgot the taste of bread, the sound of wind in the trees... We even forgot our name...
[Closeup on Smeagol's shriveled, gaunt body. Then, the scene shows Smeagol crouching in darkness, clutching the ring close to his chest. He blinks and looks around, showing that his eyes are slightly wide. Time passes and then, Smeagol, now as Gollum, opens his eyes and looks around, now showing that his eyes are really large as the screen fades to black] 
Gollum : Myyyy... Precious!
